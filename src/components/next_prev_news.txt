/*import PropTypes from 'prop-types' imports the PropTypes library from the 'prop-types' module. PropTypes is a way to document the expected types of properties passed to React components.

Once you import the PropTypes library, you can use it to define the types of props that your component should receive. This helps to catch errors early on by providing clear warnings in the console if the wrong type of data is passed to a component.

Here's an example of how to use PropTypes to define the types of props that a component should receive:

import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

Greeting.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};

export default Greeting;

import React, { Component } from 'react'
import NewsItem from './NewsItem'        // NewsItem File is here to send props
import Load from'./Load';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'


export class News extends Component {

    //We use defaultProps to specify that by default if nothing mentioned then country should be 'in' 
         defaultProps = {
        country:'in',
        category:'general'
    }
//We use PropTypes to specify that "country" should be a string
     PropTypes={
        country:PropTypes.string,
        category:PropTypes.string
    }
